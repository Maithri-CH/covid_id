[Covid ID](https://github.com/grewe/covid_id/wiki) is a project out of [iLab](http://borg.csueastbay.edu/~grewe/ilab/index.html) associated with [Computer Science at California State University East Bay](https://www.csueastbay.edu/cs/) to explore how Computer Vision and Machine Learning can be used to assist the general public with situation awareness as it relates to Covid-19.   Initially a multi-faceted approach will be taken that explores different detection modules that would assist a user with understanding potential risks related to geographical locations.
